The code is all done in python using its various scientific and ML libraries. I analyzed the dataset to determine which attributes had the largest impact on survival rate and created a few different types of models to see which was the closest fit to the actual data. Ultimately, I settled on a logistic regression model, and used the training dataset to train my model. I determined that the two best predictors of survival rate were passenger class, and passenger sex. First class passengers had the greatest chance of survival, and women had a significantly higher rate of survival than men across all passenger classes (nearly 100% of the first-class female passengers survived).
